# 🌿 Cypress Playground

> Just me, myself & my browser — exploring the wild world of Cypress 🧪

Welcome to my cozy corner of test automation! This repo is where I practice, revisit, and occasionally yell at my screen while sharpening my **Cypress** skills.

## 👩‍💻 What is this?

A hands-on, caffeine-fueled journey through:

- ✅ Writing end-to-end tests
- 🔁 Revisiting core Cypress concepts
- 🔍 Debugging like a detective
- 🤹🏽 Playing with async behavior (because timing is everything)
- 🤖 Automating all the things (but responsibly!)

Whether it's DOM elements misbehaving or async functions acting shady, this repo is my experimental lab.

## 🧠 Why does this exist?

Because sometimes:
- You forget how `cy.get()` works.
- You want to try out new patterns or plugins.
- You need a safe place to break stuff without judgment.
- You like talking to your tests. ("Why won't you just pass?!")
